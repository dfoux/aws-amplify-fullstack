This is the first colaboration made between [dfoux] (https://github.com/dfoux) and [AndrewWigginCout] (https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout) to develop and implement a fullstack web app in AWS..

The webpage can be found here: https://devtest.d35c6q303qkv2e.amplifyapp.com

The resulting project contains XX HTML, XX Python and XX Markdown files.

All the files XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxx


run simple ```Hello World``` programs and served as a quick guide on how to embed multiple properties
into our HTML code, including a Javascript script that was previously written and on how to write and run an interpreted
Python program.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxx


The 3rd HTML exercise presented by our teacher was a play around challenge where we could
edit some HTML properties to present a different output on a web browser.

After playing around with some colours I decided to clone a 
todo HTML page made by [pyscript](https://github.com/pyscript).
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This clone has an embedded python program that I've tweaked in order to gain some willpower to motivate me throughout
this bachelor.

Feel free to try it out and let me know if you can find and correct my Easter Egg. (It is easy.)

In the end of the class we were introduced to the Zen of Python by creating a single line file containing the
command ```import this```.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


The "this" library is an Easter Egg. By running this program it will output the Zen of Python by
[Tim Peters](https://github.com/tim-one). The Zen of Python are  the 19 guiding principles for Python design.
